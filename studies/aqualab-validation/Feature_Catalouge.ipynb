AUC and ROC can help to judge the efficacy of these models with different feature measures. By calculating SHAP values for different features, we could cross-validate features that we think may be good candidates for explanatory power, and detect other features as we add them in.\n","\n","The struggle detection study had a similar issue to the one we currently face- a lack of positive binary values. As Stefan notes in the paper, most models perform poorly on minority class prediction. The same SMOTE technique used in the struggle detection paper could potentially help to yield a more balanced dataset and better logistic regression models. Some more specific features, such as how many times the modeling room was visited, could potentially be translated from aggregate to per-count and used to obtain a greater level of granularity."],"metadata":{"id":"Z3yzteIYZWns"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["\n","x = df[['job13_JobTasksCompleted', 'job15_JobTasksCompleted', 'job32_JobTasksCompleted', 'job36_JobTasksCompleted']]\n","x = sm.add_constant(x)\n","\n","log_reg = sm.OLS(df['Argument_score_max_4'], x).fit()\n","print(log_reg.summary())"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"vE2sxr_uqqUA","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689229795931,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":260,"user":{"displayName":"ZACH STUDDIFORD","userId":"01657171668679429090"}},"outputId":"32f2bff3-011b-4f2f-ddd2-c46578de7687"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["                             OLS Regression Results                             \n","================================================================================\n","Dep.
