**app_id** = null  
**timestamp** = Column '*client_time*' (index 3)  
**event_name** = Columns '*6*'  
**event_data** = Column '*{'event_data': 7, 'server_time': 5, 'http_user_agent': 15}*' (DEBUG: Type <class 'dict'>)  
**event_source** = null  
**app_version** = Column '*app_version*' (index 10)  
**app_branch** = Column '*app_branch*' (index 11)  
**log_version** = Column '*log_version*' (index 12)
